 SANKALP  
 AI-Powered Online Assessment Aids for STEM Education

---
 Introduction

SANKALP is an AI-powered online education assessment aid platform designed to improve the quality of STEM learning for school students (Grades 6–12).  
The platform addresses one of the biggest challenges in online education — the lack of continuous assessment, engagement monitoring, and actionable feedback for teachers.

Unlike traditional online learning systems that focus mainly on content delivery, SANKALP emphasizes learning verification, student engagement, and data-driven teaching.  
The platform ensures that students are not just consuming content, but are actually understanding concepts at every stage of learning.

 Problem Background

Online education has become widely accessible, but it comes with several critical limitations:

- Students often watch lessons passively without fully understanding concepts  
- Teachers depend mostly on final exams to evaluate learning outcomes  
- Weak topics and struggling students are identified too late  
- Engagement levels during online classes are difficult to track  
- Language barriers reduce comprehension for students from regional backgrounds  

These issues highlight the need for a smart, assessment-oriented learning system rather than a content-only platform.

Proposed Solution

SANKALP is designed as a **continuous AI-assisted assessment system** that integrates learning, evaluation, engagement tracking, and analytics into a single platform.

The system ensures that:
- Learning happens in small, measurable steps  
- Students receive immediate feedback  
- Teachers gain real-time insights into student progress  
- Engagement is actively monitored during learning sessions  
- Language is never a barrier to understanding  

By combining AI, automation, and analytics, SANKALP transforms online learning into an interactive and accountable process.

⭐ Key Features Explained

1. Camera-Based Attention Tracking

To improve engagement during online lessons, SANKALP uses camera-based attention detection.

If the system detects that the student is not attentive:
- The lesson video automatically pauses  
- Attention data is recorded for analytics  

This feature helps reduce distractions and promotes focused learning, especially in home-based online education environments.

2. Subtopic-Level Continuous Assessment

Instead of conducting assessments only at the end of a chapter or term, SANKALP divides lessons into small subtopics.  
Each subtopic is followed by a short quiz, ensuring that students understand concepts before moving forward.

This approach:
- Encourages active learning  
- Identifies learning gaps at an early stage  
- Prevents accumulation of misunderstandings

3. AI Tutor Chatbot (Core Learning Companion)

SANKALP includes an AI Tutor Chatbot that acts as a personalized learning companion for students.

The chatbot:
- Explains concepts in simple and clear language  
- Provides examples, hints, and step-by-step guidance  
- Generates practice questions for revision  
- Supports multiple languages for regional accessibility  
- Differentiates between Learning Mode and Assessment Mode  

Importantly, the chatbot does not provide direct answers during assessments, preserving academic integrity while still supporting conceptual understanding.

4. Teacher Dashboard & Analytics

Teachers are provided with a dedicated dashboard that displays:
- Student-wise performance analysis  
- Topic-wise strengths and weaknesses  
- Engagement and attention metrics  
- Downloadable performance and progress reports  

This enables early intervention, personalized guidance, and data-driven teaching without increasing teacher workload.
