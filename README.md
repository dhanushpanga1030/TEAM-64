Project context:
- Domain: AI in Education – Assessment Aids
- Target users: School students (Grades 6–12) and Teachers
- Learning mode: Online learning (offline support will be added in future)
- Focus: Continuous assessment, engagement tracking, and teacher analytics
- Language support: Multilingual learning (English, Hindi, Telugu, Odia)

Core problem:
In online education, students often learn passively through videos without proper understanding, teachers lack real-time assessment tools, and students hesitate to ask doubts. Language barriers further reduce comprehension, especially for rural and regional-language learners.

Project objectives:
1. Provide subtopic-level quizzes after each lesson segment.
2. Automatically evaluate student performance and generate analytics.
3. Identify weak topics and learning gaps early.
4. Track student attention during video lessons using camera-based detection.
5. Motivate students through gamification (points, badges, streaks).
6. Provide teachers with dashboards, analytics, and downloadable reports.
7. Support multilingual content delivery and assessment.
8. Provide an AI Tutor Chatbot to assist students with doubts and explanations.

Required system modules:
- Student Module (login, lesson viewing, quizzes, scores, gamification, language selection)
- Assessment Module (auto quizzes, auto scoring, weak topic analysis)
- Attention Monitoring Module (camera-based presence detection)
- Teacher Module (dashboard, performance analytics, reports)
- Language Management Module (multilingual content handling)
- AI Tutor Chatbot Module (concept explanations, doubt clarification, exam-oriented answers)

AI Tutor Chatbot requirements:
- Acts as a supportive tutor, not a replacement for assessment.
- Explains concepts in simple language with examples.
- Supports multilingual responses (English, Hindi, Telugu, Odia).
- Gives hints instead of direct answers during assessments.
- Can generate practice questions for weak topics.
- Clearly differentiates between learning mode and assessment mode.

Technology preferences:
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS (with i18n support)
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: SQLite
- Gamification: Phaser.js
- AI Tutor: LLM-based chatbot with controlled prompts
- Assessment logic: Rule-based + AI-assisted evaluation
- Language handling: i18n libraries and multilingual content storage
- Deployment: Online web application

What I need from you:
1. A clear step-by-step project development plan starting from beginner level.
2. System architecture explanation including assessment, chatbot, and multilingual flow.
3. Database design showing how multilingual content and chatbot logs are stored.
4. API design including language-based content fetching and chatbot interaction.
5. Assessment workflow (quiz → scoring → analytics → weak topic detection).
6. AI Tutor Chatbot workflow and prompt strategy (learning vs assessment mode).
7. Attention tracking logic explanation (conceptual and privacy-aware).
8. Teacher dashboard features and analytics metrics.
9. Future scope suggestions (offline learning, personalization, advanced tutoring).
10. How to explain this project clearly in exams, viva, or hackathons.

Important constraints:
- Keep explanations simple and structured.
- Primary focus must remain on assessment aids.
- AI Tutor should support learning, not bypass evaluation.
- Assume beginner-to-intermediate developer level.
- Avoid unnecessary technical complexity.

Generate a clear, structured response that I can directly use to start implementation and documentation.
