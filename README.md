SANKALP  
 AI-Powered Online Assessment Aids for STEM Education

---
Introduction 
SANKALP is an AI-powered online education assessment aid platform designed to improve the quality of STEM learning for school students (Grades 6–12).  
The platform addresses one of the biggest challenges in online education — 
the lack of continuous assessment, engagement monitoring, and actionable feedback for teachers.
Unlike traditional online learning systems that focus mainly on content delivery,
SANKALP emphasizes learning verification, student engagement, and data-driven teaching.

Problem Background
Online education has become widely accessible, but it comes with critical limitations:

- Students often watch lessons passively without fully understanding concepts.
- Teachers depend mostly on final exams to evaluate learning outcomes.
- Weak topics and struggling students are identified too late.
- Engagement levels during online classes are difficult to track.
- Language barriers reduce comprehension for students from regional backgrounds.

These issues highlight the need for a smart assessment-oriented learning system rather than a content-only platform.

Proposed Solution

SANKALP is designed as a continuous AI-assisted assessment system that integrates learning, evaluation, engagement tracking, and analytics into a single platform.

The system ensures that:
- Learning happens in small, measurable steps
- Students receive immediate feedback
- Teachers gain real-time insights
- Engagement is actively monitored
- Language is never a barrier to understanding

⭐ Key Features Explained

1. Camera-Based Attention Tracking
To improve engagement during online lessons, SANKALP uses **camera-based attention detection**.

If the system detects that the student is not attentive:
- The lesson video automatically pauses
- Attention data is recorded for analytics

This feature helps reduce distractions and promotes focused learning, especially in home-based online education.

2. Subtopic-Level Continuous Assessment:
Instead of conducting assessments only at the end of a chapter or term, SANKALP divides lessons into **small subtopics**.  
Each subtopic is followed by a **short quiz**, ensuring that students understand concepts before moving forward.

This approach:
- Encourages active learning  
- Identifies learning gaps early  
- Prevents accumulation of misunderstandings

3. AI Tutor Chatbot
The platform includes an AI Tutor Chatbot that acts as a learning companion for students.

The chatbot:
- Explains concepts in simple language
- Provides examples and hints
- Generates practice questions
- Supports multiple languages
- Differentiates between **learning mode** and **assessment mode**

Importantly, the chatbot **does not provide direct answers during assessments**, preserving evaluation integrity.

4. Teacher Dashboard & Analytics
Teachers are provided with a dedicated dashboard that displays:
- Student-wise performance
- Topic-wise strength and weakness analysis
- Engagement and attention metrics
- Downloadable performance reports

This enables **early intervention** and personalized guidance without increasing teacher workload.
